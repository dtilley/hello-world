# hello-world
Welcome to the torment that is my mind. I've been stuck here for 30 years accumulating awkward and humiliating memories. 
I often have to scream the thoughts away. For some reason I decided to get a PhD in Biophysics.
My PhD often feels like a slow slide into insanity requiring me to constantly reevaluate how I conceptualize both the physical world
and how I feel about it. I cannot get anything done, the burden of trying to understand everything is a disease that inhibits 
progress and happiness. The only thing I want is for people to be happy, so "Hello World, I love you. I love that you exsist and 
experience joy. Please be patient and forgiving, the context of my thoughts and feelings are often shrouded in darkness, 
shame, anger and suffering. I love you."
